# DECISION_TREE_IMPLEMENTATION

This project highlights the successful reconstruction of a Decision Tree Classifier, achieving an impressive 94% accuracy rate. 
The classifier adeptly handles both categorical and continuous datasets, predicting classes and grouping values, respectively. 

During training, a comprehensive tree structure is formed, with leaf nodes representing majority class outputs for distinct paths. Technical aspects covered include the Tree Data Structure, Python's OOP principles, and libraries like Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, IPython, Graphviz and pydotplus. The IPython library visualizes the tree structure, while Pandas and Numpy streamline dataset handling.
